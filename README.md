## üßë‚Äçüíª Filtering Books with Django Filters

In this project, we're using ```django-filters``` to implement a filtering system for books (Livros) based on various fields like title, author, genre, and ISBN. Here's a breakdown of how the filter works.

- **Title (`titulo`)**: Filters books by partial, case-insensitive title matches.
- **Author (`autor`)**: Allows filtering by the book's author from a list of authors.
- **Genre (`genero`)**: Filters books based on their genre from a list of genres.
- **ISBN**: Filters books by partial, case-insensitive ISBN matches.

The filter is linked to the Livros model, allowing efficient searching in views. 
**Example**

````python
def livros_filters(request):
    livros_filter = LivrosFilter(request.GET, queryset=Livros.objects.all())
    return render(request, 'livros_listados.html', {'livros_filter': livros_filter})
````
